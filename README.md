Arithmetique Evaluator
---------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple (actually the simplest ever) arithmetique evaluator, that evaluates arithmetique expressions ( yep )
Sometimes it just doesn't work, and I'am too lazy to work on it, again!
But hey! At least it works, right!
